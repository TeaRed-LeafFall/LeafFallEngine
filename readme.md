# LeafFallEngine (Abandoned)

This is a project that attempted to create a 2D game engine using C#, but ultimately, it was not completed and was abandoned.

The project did not implement many features, and some of the components (projects) were also attempted to be developed separately.

This project has tormented me for almost two to three years, and I think I've come to understand something.

Developing an engine? It's not that easy. Using someone else's engine is the right path for individual developers.

I'm making the code public here for reference purposes. Perhaps there are parts of the code that others might find useful as well.

If some of the code proves helpful to your project, then it fulfills the value of this project.

It also justifies the time I've invested, and for that, I am grateful!


# LeafFallEngine（废弃）【原文】

这是一个尝试使用C#制作2d游戏引擎的项目，最后没有完成放弃了。

项目没有实现多少功能，其中部分组件（项目）也尝试被抽分出来开发了。

这个项目折磨了我差不多两三年了，我算是明白了。

开发引擎？没有那么容易。直接用别人的引擎，才是个人开发者的正路。

这里公开代码是为了通过参考，也许里面有部分代码别人也能用到。

如果部分代码对你的项目有所帮助，那就发挥了这个项目价值。

也对得起我花费的时间，感谢！
